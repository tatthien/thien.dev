This year I:

- started selling digital products on Gumroad
- started my sticker business
- migrated to a new company (same team)
- have built and scaled a totally new ecosystem for the music industry
- have spent most of the time on Nodejs, Vuejs, Golang, K8S, AWS

There are a lot of things happened in my life this year. However, I try to pick some of the highlights for the 2022 recap.

I want to give thanks to God and say a thank you to everybody who has supported me this year.
