It's time for 2019 recap. Let's check it out!

- Organized the 2nd Vue.js meetup in Vietnam.
- I'm gonna be a father soon in July 2020.
- Getting promoted to be a leader of InBusiness Vietnam.
- I decided to resign from InBusiness at the end of Jan 2020.
- Meet new friends at P where I'm going to work for after leaving InBusiness.
- Deactivate Facebook, keep Twitter only.

The items above are the main events/things in 2019, I think.

I'm excited to wait for my new job at P in Feb and my baby comes into the world in July.
