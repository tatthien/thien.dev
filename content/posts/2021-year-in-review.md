The pandemic still hits us hard. The city where I live was locked down for 3 months from July to October.

This year I:

- still work remotely from home 100%.
- stayed at home aleast 3 months without going out.
- rented a new apartment.
- (my team) changed product's vision.

These are the remarkable things that happened in my life this year. Hopefully, 2022 will be a better year.
