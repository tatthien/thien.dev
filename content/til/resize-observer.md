The [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) reports changes to the dimensions of an Element's content or border box, or the bounding box of an SVGElement.

In a simple term, when you change a `div` element's width. You can observe the changes and do some stuff.
